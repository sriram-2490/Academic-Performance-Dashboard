## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between mental health and academic performance using a comprehensive dataset of university students surveyed between 2020 and 2023. The dashboard was built in **Power BI**, utilizing **Power Query** for data transformation and **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** for calculated measures and KPIs.

## 📚 About the Dataset

The dataset offers insights into student life, mental health, and academic outcomes. It includes variables across:

- **Demographics**: Gender, Age  
- **Academics**: Course, YearOfStudy, CGPA  
- **Mental Health**: Depression, Anxiety, PanicAttack, SpecialistTreatment, SymptomFrequency_Last7Days  
- **Well-being**: HasMentalHealthSupport, SleepQuality, StudyStressLevel, StudyHoursPerWeek, AcademicEngagement  

This dataset enables a nuanced understanding of how mental health impacts academic success, which is crucial for universities and policymakers.

## 🧠 Dataset Selection and Rationale

We selected the **"University Students' Mental Health"** dataset (Chen, 2025) from Kaggle due to its relevance and rich set of variables. The dataset includes:

- Survey data from Malaysian university students (2020–2023)  
- Key indicators of mental health and academic performance  
- Longitudinal trends offering time-based insights  
- Public availability supporting reproducibility
